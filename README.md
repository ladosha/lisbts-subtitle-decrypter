# lisbts-subtitle-decrypter
Viewer and editor for the LSB-encrypted subtitle files from *Life is Strange: Before the Storm*. Files can be saved to and read from the native LSB format, or a text document with **Windows** (CRLF) or **Unix** (LF) line endings.

The LSB encode/decode functionality was inspired by flatz's [python decrypter script](http://www.zoneofgames.ru/forum/index.php?showtopic=44458&st=40&p=753726&#entry753726).
